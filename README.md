Project Title: MERT - Acoustic Music Understanding with Self-supervised Learning

Description

This project involves the re-implementation of the MERT model, a sophisticated acoustic music understanding system, using PyTorch. It leverages a Transformer-based architecture for large-scale self-supervised learning from music audio data. The model is designed to capture complex patterns in music and can be fine-tuned for various music understanding tasks.

System Requirements

Python 3.x
PyTorch (latest version recommended)
Additional Python libraries: numpy, matplotlib, librosa (for audio processing)
